# 🧱 Databricks ETL Pipeline: Auto Loader + Delta Lake + DLT

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a modular, production-grade ETL pipeline using **Databricks Auto Loader**, **Delta Lake**, and **Delta Live Tables (DLT)**. It ingests raw data incrementally, applies transformations across Bronze → Silver → Gold layers, and enforces data quality using DLT expectations.

Designed for reusability, governance, and performance optimization, this pipeline is ideal for enterprise-grade ingestion and analytics use cases.
